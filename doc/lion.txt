INTRODUCTION                                    *lion*

This plugin provides operators for aligning text to a specific character.
The operators are designed to work as closely as possible to the built-in
Vim |operators|. 

MAPPINGS                                        *lion-mappings*

[count]gl{motion}{char} Align text within {motion} to [count] occurrences
                        of {char}. Spaces are added to the left of each
                        {char} in the line up to the [count]th position in
                        the line.

[count]gL{motion}{char} Align text within {motion} to [count] occurrences
                        of {char}. Spaces are added to the right of each
                        {char} in the line up to the [count]th position in
                        the line.

[count]g={motion}       Align text within {motion} to [count] "=" characters.
                        Synonym for "[count]gl{motion}=".

[count]g:{motion}       Align text within {motion} to [count] ":" characters.
                        Synonym for "[count]gL{motion}:".

EXAMPLES                                        *lion-examples*

In the below examples, an asterisk (*) denotes the position of cursor. This
is primarily to help understand {motion}s from the example commands.

  Old text                  Command     New text ~

  $name = "Tom";             glip=      $name     = "Tom";
  $birthday =* "Jan 12";     g=ip       $birthday = "Jan 12";
  $age = 25;                            $age      = 25;

  fish, monkey, giraffe*     2gL2j,     fish, monkey,   giraffe
  a, b, c                               a,    b,        c
  45, saturday, 0                       45,   saturday, 0

ISSUES                                          *lion-issues*

These operators currently do not support |blockwise-visual| mode. They may
appear to work, but they are simply using the start and ending line numbers
and operating on each of those lines as a whole.

Text may not be properly aligned with <Tab> characters are mixed in with
other characters (that is, anywhere but the beginning of the line).

The align operators compute the virtual position of {char} by substituting
<Tab> characters with a number of spaces, defined by 'tabstop'. If used across
lines with different indentation levels, the resulting aligned text may look
inconsistent if 'tabstop' is changed (e.g. in someone else's text editor).
This may also be the case if tabs are mixed with spaces or used after the
first non-whitespace character on the line.

{char} is interpreted as a single character pattern, so a command like
"gli{." will not work.

TODO                                            *lion-todo*

1. Compute virtual position of {char} more accurately by considering whether
   the column of occurrences of <Tab> characters aligns with a tab column.
2. Add support for |blockwise-visual| mode.
3. Interpret {char} as a literal character instead of a pattern.
